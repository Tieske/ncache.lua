Ncache
======

Cache with key normalization (or many-to-1 cache).

The normalized keys will also be cached, so keys will be normalized only once.
Hence the use case is when normalization of the key is a relatively expensive
operation.


Installation
============

Install through LuaRocks (`luarocks install ncache`) or from source, see the
[github repo](https://github.com/Tieske/ncache.lua).

Documentation
=============

The docs are [available online](https://tieske.github.io/ncache.lua/), or can
be generated using [Ldoc](http://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/). Just run
`"ldoc ."` from the repo.

In the `examples` folder there are two examples (included in the tests) that
implement an IP/hostname cache and a SemVer based cache.

Tests
=====

Tests are in the `spec` folder and can be executed using the
[busted test framework](http://olivine-labs.github.io/busted/). Just run
`"busted"` from the repo.

Besides that `luacheck` is configured for linting, just run `"luacheck ."` from
the repo. And if LuaCov is installed, the Busted test-run will result in a
coverage report (file `"luacov.report.out"`).

The tests require some additional modules to be installed (only for the
tests, not for the module itself):

- busted (test framework itself)
- luacheck (linter)
- luacov (optional)
- luasocket (for the ipcache example)
- version (for the vcache example)
